# Security Policy

DeepDoxa.com takes security seriously, even though it is primarily an educational and conceptual project.  This document outlines our approach to security and how to report potential vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in DeepDoxa.com, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly.  We appreciate your help in keeping our website and its content secure.

**Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly.** Instead, report them privately to us by sending an email to:

[security@deepdoxa.com](mailto:security@deepdoxa.com) (Placeholder - Please replace with a real security contact email)

Please include the following information in your report:

*   **Description of the vulnerability:** Clearly explain the vulnerability, including how it can be exploited and its potential impact.
*   **Steps to reproduce:** Provide detailed steps that we can follow to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   **Affected URLs or code:**  Specify the affected pages, URLs, or code snippets.
*   **Your contact information (optional):**  If you wish to be acknowledged for your responsible disclosure, please provide your name or handle.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe and will do our best to investigate and address the issue promptly.

## Response Process

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we will:

1.  **Acknowledge Receipt:**  Confirm receipt of your report and thank you for your responsible disclosure.
2.  **Investigate:**  Our (conceptual) team will investigate the reported vulnerability to understand its nature and scope.
3.  **Remediation (If Applicable):**  If the vulnerability is confirmed and deemed applicable to our project, we will work to remediate it.  Given the nature of DeepDoxa.com as a static website, remediation might involve content updates or configuration changes.
4.  **Disclosure (Limited):**  We may, at our discretion and after remediation, choose to disclose limited information about the vulnerability, primarily for educational purposes and to inform users of any potential (though unlikely in this context) risks.  We will not disclose your identity without your explicit consent.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the DeepDoxa.com website and its publicly accessible content.  Vulnerabilities that are considered in scope include:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Vulnerabilities that allow malicious scripts to be injected into our web pages.
*   **Content Injection:**  Vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized modification or injection of content on the website.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Vulnerabilities that could potentially disrupt access to the website (though given the static nature, this is less likely).
*   **Other Website Integrity Issues:** Any other vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity, availability, or intended functionality of the DeepDoxa.com website.

## Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for this security policy:

*   **Philosophical or Conceptual Discussions:**  Disagreements with the philosophical concepts or theories presented on DeepDoxa.com are not considered security vulnerabilities.
*   **Content Accuracy (Non-Security Related):**  Reports of factual inaccuracies or typos in the content, unless they directly relate to a security issue, are not considered security vulnerabilities (please use the contact form for general feedback).
*   **Third-Party Services:**  Security vulnerabilities in third-party services that DeepDoxa.com may link to or utilize (e.g., external websites linked in articles, Unsplash images) are outside the scope of this policy and should be reported to the respective service providers.
*   **"Social Engineering" against Users:** As DeepDoxa.com does not collect or store sensitive user data, vulnerabilities related to social engineering attacks targeting website *users* are largely out of scope in a practical sense. However, if you identify vectors within our site that could *facilitate* such attacks elsewhere, please report them.

## Disclaimer

DeepDoxa.com is a conceptual and educational project developed on a "best effort" basis. While we strive to maintain a secure website, we cannot guarantee absolute security.  We appreciate the community's help in identifying and reporting potential security issues responsibly.
