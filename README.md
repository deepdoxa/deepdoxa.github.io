# DeepDoxa.com - Exploring Collective Belief

## Project Description

DeepDoxa.com is a website dedicated to exploring the intricate relationship between **quantum physics, algorithmic complexity, and the formation of collective belief (Doxa)**.  It delves into the hidden architectures that shape our understanding of the world, examining how societal assumptions and shared knowledge are constructed and influenced in the age of AI and interconnected networks.

The site aims to be an educational resource, providing insightful content, analogies, and links to further reading, all presented in a minimalist and accessible style.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Content:**  In-depth explorations of Quantum Entanglement, Algorithmic Complexity, Doxa Entanglement, and the impact of AI on society.
*   **Multi-Perspective Approach:** Presents diverse viewpoints on AI, drawing from technologists, ethicists, safety researchers, economists, and philosophers.
*   **Credible References:**  Extensive use of links to Wikipedia and other reputable sources to enhance information and encourage deeper learning.
*   **Practical Framework:** Introduces the "Deep Doxa Method," a step-by-step guide for analyzing and understanding collective belief systems.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Includes dynamic content filtering (AI Perspectives) and a functional contact form.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing experience across devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile).
*   **Minimalist and Stylish Design:** Clean, code-inspired aesthetic with a focus on readability and clarity.
*   **Dynamic Copyright:**  Footer copyright year is dynamically updated using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the website content and semantic markup.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the website, including layout, typography, and responsiveness. Utilizes CSS variables for easy customization.
*   **JavaScript:** For dynamic functionality, including:
    *   Smooth scrolling navigation
    *   Sticky header effect
    *   Fade-in animations on scroll
    *   Dynamic form generation and basic validation
    *   AI perspective filtering using links
    *   Dynamic copyright year update

## How to Run Locally

To run DeepDoxa.com locally, simply:

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**  Download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your local machine.
2.  **Open `index.html`:**  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

No server or special setup is required as the website is built using client-side technologies.
